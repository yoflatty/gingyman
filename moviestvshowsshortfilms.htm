Gingy was created by the Muffin Man, along with the rest of the Gingerbread people. 
<br>
Some years later, he attended Cookie Academy in Home Economics. 
<br>
Sometime later, he got married to a red-head gingerbread woman, but the relationship did not last.

In Lord Farquaad's dungeon, Gingy is first seen being interrogated about other fairytale creatures' whereabouts. 
<br>
Farquaad has directed Thelonious, one of Farquaad's henchmen, to torment Gingy by ripping off his legs and dunk him in a glass of milk. 
<br>
Farquaad even mocks him by making his legs scurry around while saying, "Run, run, run, as fast as you can! You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man!", before hurling one of his legs at him and shattering the other leg in front of him. 
<br>
Farquaad threatens to remove Gingy's gumdrop buttons after Gingy refuses and spits in his face. 
<br>
Gingy begins to discuss the Muffin Man rhyme as a result of this (Fooling Farquaad for the moment).
<br>
Farquaad's captain, however, interrupts the questioning and tells Farquaad that they have discovered the Magic Mirror. 
<br>
Gingy screams at him to not give up any fairytale places as the Magic Mirror awakens, and Farquaad immediately throws him into a trash can.

<p4 style="color: rgb black; text-align: left; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" >

Gingy's other leg is replaced at long last.
<br>
Gingy and the other fairy tale animals keep an eye on the swamp while Shrek, Princess Fiona, and Donkey go to Far Far Away.
<br>
He isn't seen again until later in the movie, when he witnesses Shrek, Donkey, and Puss in Boots being arrested.
<br>
The party then proceeds to the hospital, where they assist the trio in their escape.
<br>
After that, Shrek and Gingerbread Man go to the Muffin Man's house and make Mongo, a giant gingerbread man.
<br>
Shrek infiltrates the castle using Mongo.
<br>
Mongo keeps the door open, but due to numerous hot milk attacks, his arms become severed.
<br>
Mongo's gingerbread body isn't strong enough to withstand two waves of boiling liquid.
<br>
he weapons remain in place for as long as Shrek needs to enter the castle.
<br>
Mongo, on the other hand, stays in the moat after the guards dump hot milk on him.
<br>
Gingy was upset, and he almost got trapped in the moat himself, but Puss saved him, and Mongo drowned slowly in the moat.

Gingy and Pinocchio presented Fiona with a baby carrier as a gift.
<br>
They demanded to know where Shrek was when Prince Charming and Captain Hook broke in.
<br>
When approached by Hook, Gingy declined to say, and his life flashed before his eyes.
<br>
He was abandoned in a bakery, but Donkey and Puss in Boots saved him.
<br>
Gingy was also present at the final rescue, where he slipped down Rapunzel's hair to reveal that it was a wig.

Gingy admits that he is scared of Santa Claus because he ate Suzy, but no one believes him.
<br>
When Shrek and the gang go outside to see Santa ride in his sleigh at the end of the movie, Gingy screams and runs back inside.

When Shrek enters the alternate universe, Gingy appears as a gladiator battling animal crackers with a lollipop as a sword.
<br>
Later, he is seen approaching Shrek and offering Rumpelstiltskin details.
<br>
Unfortunately, before he can give Shrek any detail, a fat and lazy Puss eats him.
<br>
The true Gingy, on the other hand, is still alive and well when Shrek returns to the real world at the end.
<br>
Gingy battles Shrek alongside Pinocchio, The Big Bad Wolf, The Three Little Pigs, and The Three Blind Mice in a deleted scene.
<br>
He also attacks Shrek with his Animal Crackers.

Gingy joins Shrek and the gang at an abandoned Duloc to tell scary tales.
<br>
In the story "The Bride of Gingy," he recalls his involvement in a potentially fatal relationship.
<br>
Beginning by telling the Muffin Man about how his most recent girlfriend dumped him, he is forced to create a woman who will "love him forever."
<br>
He gets his wish, and Sugar, his new girlfriend, is born.
<br>
He seeks to get away from her after noticing her clingy behaviour, which has brought his personal life to a halt.
<br>
This backfires when Sugar attempts to persuade him to return, only to drown in the cookie dough.
<br>
Gingy had no idea that the baking machine had induced zombie Sugars to break into his house and eat him.
<br>
He is called out for still being alive despite the story's climax, after scaring the three pigs and boring the Big Bad Wolf.
<br>
He then flees the scene, claiming to have seen Farquaad's ghost.

"Gingerbread Man vs. Humpty Dumpty" was his only appearance in the series.
